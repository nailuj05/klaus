# Klaus

Klaus is a simple stack based language with a compiler implemented in OCaml. 
Its name is a reference to [Staplerfahrer Klaus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dJdCJMyBi5I) (Stapel being Stack in german).

## Building

This project is build using my [noob build system](https://github.com/nailuj05/noob) on Linux. 
You will have to build the noob.c file using your systems C compiler, then run the executable to build the main compiler using ocamlc.

*Further information about the language will follow*
